              times. Born in Brazil, he played indoor volleyball in prominent
              clubs such as Banespa, Suzano and Chapec√≥ until an injury took him
              to recover on the beach.

              Beach Volleyball National Tournaments and the FIVB Beach
              Volleyball Tours for more than two decades, having competed for
              his country in the 2004 Olympic Games, in Athens.
